"""SKILLS-08 - install the bundled Signal House agent skills into a project.

Exposed as the ``signalhouse-skills`` console script.

Why this is a command and not automatic: a pip wheel has no post-install hook. That is deliberate
on packaging's part, and there is no supported way around it that does not involve shipping an
sdist and forcing a source build on every user. So where the npm package can offer to place the
skills during ``npm install``, the Python package ships them and the developer runs one command.

The safety rules match the npm installer, because the risk is the same:

* PROJECT scope by default. It writes under the current directory, not the home directory.
* It never overwrites a file whose contents differ from what a previous run wrote. An edited skill
  belongs to the developer.
* It reports what it changed, including which version it moved from.

The skills are bundled in the wheel, so this does no network access.
