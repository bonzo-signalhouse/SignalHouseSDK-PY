"""Voice Analytics — aggregated call metrics for the portal Voice Analytics view.

Wraps voice-backend's ``GET /voice/stats/voice-analytics``. Returns per-direction
summary tiles (both directions) plus byDate / byNumber / byCarrier status
breakdowns for charts. Distinct from ``sdk.voice.call_logs``, which is the raw
call history read surface. Accessed via ``sdk.voice.analytics``.

        Args:
            date_from: ISO-8601 lower bound on call start time. Serialized as
                ``dateFrom``.
            date_to: ISO-8601 upper bound on call start time. Serialized as
                ``dateTo``.
            group_by: Bucket size for the byDate breakdown (``day``, ``week``,
                ``month``; default ``day``). Serialized as ``groupBy``.
            direction: Restrict the breakdowns to one direction (``INBOUND``,
                ``OUTBOUND``). Summary tiles always cover both.
            call_source: Comma-separated ``CallLog.callSource`` list
                (``SIP_TRUNK``, ``PROGRAMMABLE_VOICE``, ``AI_VOICE``, ``WEBRTC``,
                ``VOICEMAIL``, ``CONFERENCE``, ``PSTN``). Serialized as
                ``callSource``.
            subgroup_id: Filter by owning subgroup. Serialized as ``subgroupId``.
            number: Substring match against either leg (from OR to).
            carrier: Filter by carrier.
            token: Optional bearer token for authentication.
            headers: Additional headers to include in the request.
