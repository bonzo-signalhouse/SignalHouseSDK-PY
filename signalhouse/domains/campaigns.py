            refreshed periodically from analytics rather than computed per request: `{ sevenDay, thirtyDay,
            updatedAt }`, each window being `{ score, label, scoredCount, positive, neutral, negative }`. The
            object is always present and fully populated, so it can be read without a presence check.
            `score` is a volume-weighted average in -100..100 and is null when nothing was scored in the
            window, which is not the same as a score of 0 -- null means nobody replied, 0 means replies
            averaged neutral. `updatedAt` is null until the first rollup writes the record, and it tracks when
            the figures last CHANGED, not when the job last ran.

            Every record also carries a `health` object -- trailing 7-day and 30-day delivery/opt-out health from
            the same periodic refresh: `{ sevenDay, thirtyDay, updatedAt }`, each window being `{ score,
            deliveryRate, optOutRate, deliveryScore, optOutScore, messagesSent, messagesDelivered, messagesFailed,
            optOuts }`. `score` is 1.0..10.0 (the mean of the two bucket scores) and is null when nothing was sent
            in the window; the volumes say how much traffic sits behind it. A campaign's figure is scored from the
            campaign's own summed counters, never averaged from its numbers. For a live figure use GET /number/health
